# Week-5-team-project Data Bazengas

## Description.

We were contracted as data scientist by the Commission on the Status of Women (COSW), a commission of the City and State of San Francisco, to analyse San Francisco employee data and identify whether there exists a gender wage gap in the employee salaries of the State of San Francisco and if so, to what extent this gap has moved since the census of 2008, and the subsequent establishment of the COSW in San Francisco to address this  gap.  


## Conclusion.

The average pay for females was 86475.67USD and for males was 104254.64USD whereas the average pay for all was 93,707. This means that men earn 10547.87 more from mean pay and females earn 7231.09 less from the males. This means that females earn 82.94% of what men earn.
 
Among those earning above average pay, 52.98% were male and 30.74% were female whereas the rest were not specified their gender.
Our analysis revealed that the average pay per year for males is higher compared to females. The most popular job is that of the transit operator which is mostly populated by the males. The most popular female jobs  in San Francisco in the period of study worked as special nurses and registered nurses.
Our analysis found that since COSW was established in 2009 to date, the gender wage gap has closed by 3%.

## Recommendations.

We recommend that since women earn 82% of what men earn, and only 30% of women earn above average pay, more study can be done to identify the reasons why women earn less than men in general.
We recommend that the State of San Francisco allocates more resources to COSW to further close the wage gap beyond 3 % by the next census.
